2 things:
- simple tables: no logic, no interactivity
- advanced tables (dataframe), possible to search, etc...



--> but should be possible to put anything a column --> sounds more like a layout  ?
adding to table will be easy via loop ?
JtTable t = Jt.table(rows, columns);

keys = m.keys()
for (int i =0; i<keys.size()) {
    colName = keys.get(i);
    col = m.get(colName)
    for (int i=0, i<col.length, i++) {
       val = col[val];
       Jt.someStuff(val).use(t.cell(row, col))
    }
}

and from this:
Jt.table(Map<> --> will autofill the values)
Jt.table(List<Objects> --> will autofill the values too --> will do a best effort inference)

OR: need to make this generic for Jt.dataframe too.

transformations are replaced

transform at row, transform at column, transform at index --> will inject div containers
2 kind of runnables: void --> should be a valid jeamlit snippet that will produce some component
                     returns something --> the output will be used

- markdown should be supported in all cells
- allow transforms, per cell ? per column ? what about list of objects ?
- It'll make it hard to perform transforms without reflection
- is this really a need ?


st.table: everything is treated as a markdown string --> columns can be overwritten by use of JtLayout - no return value
st.dataframe --> allow transforms and advanced usage

or keep things as simple as possible, do not allow transforms
then implement dataframe


Keep things extremely simple for table:
Map()
List(objects)
Map<S
